# AAP Project Export and Import Tools

## Overview
The two Python scripts, aap_export.py and aap_import.py are designed to facilitate the export and import of projects in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). These tools are intended to streamline the process of transferring projects(w/ project repo sync), along with their associated objects such as credential_types, credentials(w/o secrets), inventories, inventory_sources(w/ source sync), job templates, and execution environments, between different instances of AAP.

## aap_export.py
The aap_export.py script is used to export a specified project from an AAP instance. It captures all relevant details and dependencies of the project, including job templates, execution environments, credential_types, credentials(w/o secrets), and inventories. The exported data is saved in a JSON file in the local directory.

## aap_import.py
The aap_import.py script is designed to import a project into an AAP instance. It reads the project data from a JSON file (generated by the export script) and recreates the project in the target AAP instance, including all associated objects.

## Assumptions
Before using these scripts, please be aware of the following assumptions:

Ansible Vault Files:  
It is assumed that there are two Ansible Vault .yml files, each containing an access token with the key token. These tokens are used for authentication when prompted by the scripts.

Local Directory for JSON Files:  
The export script saves the JSON file to the local directory, and the import script expects to find the JSON file in the local directory unless additional path information is provided.

Manual Update of Secrets:  
Users will need to manually update secret values in the credentials after import, as these are not fully exported for security reasons.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed
Access to Ansible Automation Platform instances
Required Python packages: requests, urllib3, ansible
Usage
Exporting a Project
Run python aap_export.py.
Enter the hostname or IP of the AAP instance from which to export.
Provide the Ansible Vault password when prompted.
Enter the name of the project to export.
The script will save the project data in a JSON file in the local directory.
Importing a Project
Run python aap_import.py.
Enter the hostname or IP of the AAP instance to which to import.
Provide the Ansible Vault password when prompted.
Enter the filename of the JSON file to import.
The script will read the JSON file and recreate the project in the specified AAP instance.
